# Axiom

Axiom is an AI-powered desktop application that brings full-project context to your chat. It is designed for developers who need an AI assistant that deeply understands their codebase, local environment, and daily workflow.

Combines a powerful chat interface with native access to your file system, Git, terminal, and Docker. It operates on a strict local-first philosophy, ensuring your code, chat history, and credentials remain entirely on your machine.

### Core Features

- **Project-Aware AI Modes:** Choose between Agent (read/write/execute), Plan, Debug, and Ask (read-only) modes. The AI can navigate code, apply precise diffs, and run sandboxed commands.
- **Deep Environment Integration:** Includes a built-in multi-session terminal, a comprehensive Git panel (diff, commit, worktrees, sync), and a runtime manager for npm, Composer, and Docker Compose.
- **Precision Context Control:** Use `@` mentions to inject specific files, previous chat history, custom rules, skills, or multi-step pipelines directly into your prompt.
- **Model Agnostic:** Seamlessly switch between major cloud providers, custom endpoints, local GGUF models, and Ollama.
- **Extensible Tooling:** Native support for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, allowing the AI to use external tools alongside built-in code navigation and execution capabilities.
